# IntuneScript
I think Intune is stupid. WDS worked better. But here we are.

This provides a script for automating the workflow of installing Windows-Autopilot and configuring a computer for use with Intune.
It is tailor-made for my department at FAU, so in case anyone got really lost, and stumbled on this...
you should change the 'GroupTag' field in the 'AustinsIntuneScript.ps1' script (line 32).

Okay bye.
