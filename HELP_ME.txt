Just right-click the "RunIntune" batch file.
Then click "Run as Administrator"

The batch file will copy the powershell script to `C:\`, and then starts it.
That powershell script handles installing and running the Intune commands.

when the script finishes, it will automatically launch the "System Reset" menu for you.
If an error occurrs, the script will stop, and wait for you to press 'Y' to continue.
If you accidentally forget to run-as-administrator, the script will warn you and stop.
